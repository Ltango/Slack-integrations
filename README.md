# Slack-integrations
Using slack as the interface between a Jira application, and a Sentinel One application

Iteractive messages, drop down menus, json as a database, flask as a server, shutting down your deskmates computer all with a simple message to slack (after some authorization of course.)  This is an ongoing project of taking functionality from different platforms and using Slack as the interface.
